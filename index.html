 <h1 class="section-two__about">About Me</h1>
 <p class="section-two__desc">Hello! I’m Mufeedh M, a passionate and dedicated graduate in B.Sc. Computer Science with specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (AI&DS). With a strong foundation in computational thinking, data structures, and intelligent systems, I’ve grown to develop a deep interest in web development, particularly in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve cultivated skills that merge both the analytical power of AI and the creative structure of web development. My program not only taught me how to understand complex data but also how to build smart, scalable applications. These skills have allowed me to bridge the gap between machine intelligence and human interaction.

From the early stages of my degree, I found myself naturally drawn to building interactive and dynamic websites. I began experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gradually transitioned into the full MERN stack — which felt like the perfect match for my logical thinking and problem-solving mindset.

Currently, I am seeking a role as a MERN Stack Developer, where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to learn and grow. I love turning ideas into applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly and responsive. I believe in clean code, performance optimization, and intuitive UI/UX design.

I’ve worked on various mini-projects, ranging from static web pages to full-stack applications that include login systems, API integrations, and dynamic data handling using MongoDB. These experiences have helped me become comfortable with both front-end and back-end development, giving me a well-rounded understanding of how modern web applications work.</p>
