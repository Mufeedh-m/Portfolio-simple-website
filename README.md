# 💼 Personal Portfolio Website

This is a simple and clean portfolio website built using only HTML and CSS. It contains two main pages:

- **Home Page** – A brief introduction about me, my skills, and purpose.
- **Contact Page** – A static contact form with basic styling and structure.

This project showcases my foundational skills in frontend development and helps establish my personal web presence.
